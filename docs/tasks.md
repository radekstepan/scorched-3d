# Tasks

System instruction: Work through every item in ## List below, top to bottom, executing each task in its own fresh subagent. Rules:

1. One task per subagent: spawn a single subagent for the current list item only, giving it the task text plus everything below as its brief.
2. Strictly sequential: wait for the subagent to finish (and its commit to land) before spawning the next one. Never run two task subagents in parallel.
3. Each subagent must: implement the task, add tests covering the change, and commit the result on completion.
4. Do not run Playwright (unit/integration tests only).
5. Each commit must include a writeup of what changed inside the changeset itself (see rule 9). Record any important decisions in that writeup. Do not create separate markdown files in docs/tasks/. Never append writeups to docs/tasks.md itself.
6. If a task changes architecture or introduces a complex feature, update the app documentation (README.md) in the same commit.
7. If a task is blocked or fails, stop the loop and report — do not skip ahead to the next item.
8. Keep track of learnings from each task. Then once done with all of the tasks summarize the learnings into a markdown document so that we do not repeat the same mistakes over and over (in `docs/learnings.md`).
9. Each subagent must add a changeset (`yarn changeset`) describing its change and include it in the same commit, so versions keep moving. The changeset body is the task writeup: summarize what changed and why, including any important decisions. See `.changeset/README.md` and the "Versioning" section in `docs/development.md` for the workflow.

## List

Right click unit attacks them if 1+ units are selected.

Toggle camera "follow battle" mode. Auto-track the centroid of recent combat. Right now the player must hunt for the action manually.

Sound. Add great sound effects. Zooming in makes the sound louder.

Economy-lite. Factories currently spawn on timers. Tie reinforcements to map control (territory system already exists!): hold more ground → faster spawns. Suddenly positioning matters strategically.

Unit veterancy. Units that survive kills get +damage/range badges. Zero new systems needed (kill attribution + a multiplier), huge emotional attachment payoff. When a unit gets promoted do a rotating slightly larger military chevrons. Unit "gains" it and shows somewhere close to the health and when you select the unit too.
