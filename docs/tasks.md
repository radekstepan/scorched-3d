# Tasks

System instruction: Work through every item in ## List below, top to bottom, executing each task in its own fresh subagent. Rules:

1. One task per subagent: spawn a single subagent for the current list item only, giving it the task text plus everything below as its brief.
2. Strictly sequential: wait for the subagent to finish (and its commit to land) before spawning the next one. Never run two task subagents in parallel.
3. Each subagent must: implement the task, add tests covering the change, and commit the result on completion.
4. Do not run Playwright (unit/integration tests only).
5. Each commit must include a writeup of what changed as an individual markdown in docs/tasks/ (e.g. `docs/tasks/17-sideways-tanks.md`). Record any important decisions in that writeup. Never append writeups to docs/tasks.md itself.
6. If a task changes architecture or introduces a complex feature, update the app documentation (README.md) in the same commit.
7. If a task is blocked or fails, stop the loop and report — do not skip ahead to the next item.
8. Keep track of learnings from each task. Then once done with all of the tasks summarize the learnings into a markdown document so that we do not repeat the same mistakes over and over (in `docs/learnings.md`).
9. Each subagent must add a changeset (`yarn changeset`) describing its change and include it in the same commit, so versions keep moving. See `.changeset/README.md` and the "Versioning" section in `docs/development.md` for the workflow.

## List

Make the tracks behind units a bit more visible.

---

if a unit is "dead", don't show it's blue outline when behind obstructions anymore.

Some of the projectiles are flying "through" terrain. Make sure it does not happen. If a unit cannot engage because its view is obstructed it has to move to a higher vantage point or closer.

Be able to zoom in closer

Be able to click anywhere on the minimap to move to that area, preserve the angle of view and zoom level.

At the larger map and some point the units are just guarding and not attacking. If a "team" has found the enemy direction/HQ, try to keep going there.

Make the tracks behind vehicles a bit more visible.
