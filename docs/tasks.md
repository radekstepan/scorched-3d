# Tasks

System instruction: Work through every item in ## List below, top to bottom, executing each task in its own fresh subagent. Rules:

1. One task per subagent: spawn a single subagent for the current list item only, giving it the task text plus everything below as its brief.
2. Strictly sequential: wait for the subagent to finish (and its commit to land) before spawning the next one. Never run two task subagents in parallel.
3. Each subagent must: implement the task, add tests covering the change, and commit the result on completion.
4. Do not run Playwright (unit/integration tests only).
5. Each commit must include a writeup of what changed in docs/tasks. Record any important decisions in that writeup.
6. If a task changes architecture or introduces a complex feature, update the app documentation (README.md) in the same commit.
7. If a task is blocked or fails, stop the loop and report — do not skip ahead to the next item.
8. Keep track of learnings from each task. Then once done with all of the tasks summarize the learnings into a markdown document so that we do not repeat the same mistakes over and over (in `docs/learnings.md`).
9. Each subagent must add a changeset (`yarn changeset`) describing its change and include it in the same commit, so versions keep moving. See `.changeset/README.md` and the "Versioning" section in `docs/development.md` for the workflow.

Use sibling `nanolathe` repo for inspiration.

## List

Tanks are driving sideaways...

It should be harder driving through rough terrain, trees etc.

Show damage to models, like charring, smoke here and there etc.

Improve the trees on fire, the fire looks like little cones...

The brown blotches on the ground are weird. Is that from projectiles exploding? Make them more "believable. And you can "flatten the terrain a tiny bit. Right now it looks like mud.

Some of the units are scaling too high of a terrain, make the physics look more believable. And start with a smaller height scale.
